# JS FOR LOOP

## Part A

1. Write a `for` loop that counts from 1 to 5 and logs each number to the console.

2. Create a `for` loop that prints the multiples of 3 from 3 to 15.

3. Write a `for` loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 and store the result in a variable called `total`.

4. Create a `for` loop to print the square of numbers from 1 to 5.

5. Write a `for` loop that logs the numbers from 10 down to 1.

6. Use a `for` loop to print "Hello, World!" five times, each on a new line.

7. Create a `for` loop that logs the even numbers from 2 to 10.

8. Write a `for` loop to calculate the product of numbers from 1 to 5 and store the result in a variable called `product`.

9. Use a `for` loop to print the numbers from 5 to 15, but skip every even number.

10. Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 0 to 3 in reverse order (3, 2, 1, 0).

## Part B

1. Use a single for loop to create a sequence that starts from 1, increments by 1 until it reaches 10, and then decrements by 1 until it reaches 1

2.  Use a single for loop to create a sequence that starts from 1, increments by 1 until it reaches 10, and then decrements by 2 and shows only even numbers backward till it reaches 2.

3.  Use a single for loop to create a sequence that starts from 1, increments by 1 until it reaches 20, and then decrements by showing numbers that are divisible by 3 until it reaches 3
