Question 4: What is the result of the following expression?
const result4 = true && (false || true) && (!false || true);

Question 5: What is the result of the following expression?
const result5 = (false && true) || (true && !false);

Question 6: What is the result of the following expression?
const result6 = !(false && true) || (true && !false);

Question 7: What is the result of the following expression?
const result7 = true && false && true || false || true;

Question 8: What is the result of the following expression?
const result8 = false || true && false && true || true;

Question 9: What is the result of the following expression?
const result9 = (false || true) && (false && true || true);

Question 10: What is the result of the following expression?

## Part B

Create functions that interpret and solve the questions below:

1) If there are two doors, one leading to treasure and the other to a dragon's lair, and you have two keys labeled "A" and "B." Key "A" opens the door to treasure, and key "B" opens the door to the dragon's lair. Create a function to determine which key opens the door to the treasure.

2) In a game of chance, you have two cards labeled "Red" and "Blue." One card leads to a prize, and the other to a penalty. Create a function to determine which card leads to the prize.

3) In a computer program, you have two variables, "isLogged" and "isAdmin." If "isLogged" is true, it means a user is logged in, and if "isAdmin" is true, it means the user has admin privileges. Create a function to check if the user is both logged in and has admin privileges.

4) In a password recovery system, there are two security questions: "What is your favorite color?" and "What is your pet's name?" If the correct answers to both questions are provided, the password is reset. Create a function to check if both security questions are answered correctly.

5) In a voting system, there are two criteria for a vote to be valid: the voter must be at least 18 years old and a citizen of the country. Create a function to determine if a person's vote is valid based on their age and citizenship status.
